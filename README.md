# VORTRAG: NO QUICK WINS - DEMO

## Running the Demo

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project root directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    # or pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Start the development server:**
    After the dependencies are installed, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    # or pnpm dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, and you should see a URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your terminal. Open this URL in your web browser to see the application.

## Getting Started with the Feedback Modal Feature

This demo includes a solution design (`solutiondesign.md`) and a detailed task list (`feedback-modal-tasks.md`) for implementing a user feedback modal.

To begin working on this feature with an AI assistant, you can use a prompt like the following:

```
"Let's start implementing the feedback modal feature. Please begin begin with the tasks from feedback-modal-tasks.md. using the EPCC rule.
```

This will guide the AI to start the coding phase based on the predefined tasks.
